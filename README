This is my customised fork of github.com/peterh/liner

That upstream package has to maintain a stable public API. Here, I can make
changes and additions without that constraint.

---

Runes considered boundaries for word-based movement and deletion (in addition
to whitespace) can now be set by clients of the package.

See: SetPunctuation

---

Special treatment of ^C has been removed. ^C (and all other control-codes not
used by liner for editing) can now be handled by clients of the package in a
general manner.

See: SetUnusedControlCodeHandler
